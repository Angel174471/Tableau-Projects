### Prosper Loan Data Visualization
#### About
Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that aims to connect people who need money with those people who have the money to invest. In this data analysis project, I have explored the Prosper dataset and used Tableau to create my visualizations.

#### Dataset
The Prosper loan data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. The dataset and data-dictionary can be found on below links.

#### Summary
My Tableau story dives deep into the dynamics among the key stakeholders in peer-to-peer lending: borrowers, lenders, and our company. Through a comprehensive time series analysis from 2007 to 2014, I uncovered crucial insights about loan trends, borrower credit scores, and default rates.
Since 2009, the loan business has seen significant growth, peaking in 2013, but it experienced a decline in early 2014. Concurrently, borrowers' credit scores showed a consistent downward trend over this period, while some states faced default rates surpassing 30%.
Further exploration focused on defaulters, reasons for defaults, and borrowers' motivations. Strikingly, individuals with $0 income exhibited the highest default rates, with a preference for investing in 'D' rated loans. A unique pattern emerged among college students enrolled in higher-grade studies, who had more loans and higher borrower and default rates. Surprisingly, sophomore students stood out as the top defaulters despite having fewer loans.
Additionally, I delved into incomes and losses based on different loan ratings. Astonishingly, the 'HR' loan rating, typically given to credit-worthy borrowers, incurred the highest losses. Moreover, loans rated C and D displayed the highest losses, signifying their higher risk levels.
Armed with these valuable findings, we aim to implement robust risk mitigation strategies, fostering a secure and rewarding experience for lenders and borrowers on our peer-to-peer money market platform. For a comprehensive understanding of the insights, please explore the Tableau visualizations and results presented in the story.
