# Tableau-Projects
This repository contains the analysis and visualizations I have created in Tableau.

## About
Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence tool created by Tableau Software. Tableau can help anyone see and understand their data. For my projects I have chosen to use Tableau because it can connect to almost any database, drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click.

## Dependencies
To execute my rojects you need to have Tableau version 10 or above

## Projects
### Prosper Loan Data Visualization
The Prosper Loan data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. The [Dataset-dictionary](https://github.com/jubins/Tableau-Projects/blob/master/ProsperLoanData/data/ProsperLoanData-VariableDefinitions.csv) and [Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jubins/Tableau-Projects/master/ProsperLoanData/data/prosperLoanData.csv) used in this project can be found on these links.

The data is available from 2005 and tells what sorts you loans people have applied and who defaulted. I performed Time Seres Analysis on this dataset and found that Since 2009 the online personal loan business has increased steadily and climbed up quickly since 2013 and then dropped down at the beginning of 2014. However, the borrower credit score has went down over time. Also, the Default Rate in some states were higher than 30%.
