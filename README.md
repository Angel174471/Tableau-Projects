# Tableau-Projects
This repository contains the analysis and visualizations I have created in Tableau.

## About
Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence tool created by Tableau Software. Tableau can help anyone see and understand their data. For my projects I have chosen to use Tableau because it can connect to almost any database, drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click.

## Dependencies
To execute my rojects you need to have Tableau version 10 or above

## Projects
### Prosper Loan Data Visualization
Since 2009, the online personal loan business has increased steadily and climbed up quickly since 2013 and then dropped down at the beginning of 2014. However, the borrower credit score has went down over time. Also, the Default Rate in some states were higher than 30%.
